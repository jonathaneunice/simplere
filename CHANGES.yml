  version: 1.2.0
  date: August 14, 2015
  notes: Realized imports were overly restrictive, requiring clients of module to
    needlessly (and contra docs) manually import ``re`` and construct the ``match``
    object. Fixed. Bumped minor version number to reflect de facto API change.

  version: 1.0.5
  date: null
  notes: >
    In several dot-releases, have added support for Travis-CI cloud-based continuous
    integration testing, Sphinx-based documentation, and readthedocs.org hosted documentation.
    The Travis bit has required a separate Github repository be created. It is managed
    out of the same development directory, overlaying the existing Mercurial / Bitbucket
    repo. So far, that has caused no problems.

    Documentation somewhat improved.

  version: 1.0.0
  date: null
  notes: >
    Cleaned up source for better PEP8 conformance

    Bumped version number to 1.0 as part of move to `semantic versioning <http://semver.org>`_,
    or at least enough of it so as to not screw up Python installation procedures
    (which don't seem to understand 0.401 is a lesser version that 0.5, because 401
    > 5)
